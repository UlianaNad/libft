# Libft

## Project Description  
Libft is a custom C library created as part of the Hive Helsinki (42 school) curriculum. It contains a collection of basic functions for working with strings, memory, characters, and other common operations that are not fully available in the standard C library.

## Purpose  
The goal of this project is to learn how to implement fundamental C functions from scratch, deepen understanding of pointers, memory management, and string manipulation, and strengthen core C programming skills.

## Features  
The library includes approximately 30 essential functions, such as:  
- String functions: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strcat`, `ft_strncmp`  
- Memory functions: `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, `ft_memchr`  
- Character checks: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalnum`, `ft_isprint`  
- Conversions: `ft_atoi`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`  
- Additional utility functions to facilitate programming
